# Mobileadora client

**WARNING THIS README IS STILL UNFINISHED, YOU ARE ENTERING THE DANGER ZONE**

A simple html page + pwa that can be used to connect to my [other app](https://github.com/Catomag/Mobileadora). It can create buttons, joysticks, sliders and more whilst communicating efficiently with my custom server. 

## Deets
No real deets for this one, if you want to use it; simply host an http server and tell your monky friends to connect to it. After that, the app will do its thing. Just make sure you have an actual server running and you know its ip and stuff, you need that info to connect obviously.


Made in raw untamed js and html5 because react is for weaklings.
